# Gemini_pro 
 google LLM model Integration 
 ## Prerequisites
Before you can run the code and effectively integrate the Gemini model, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Google API Credentials**: Obtain the necessary API credentials from the Google API Console. You'll need the API key and any other relevant authentication information.

2. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is designed to work with Python, and you'll need it to run the code.

## Configuration
Follow these steps to configure your Google API for integration:

1. **Obtain Google API Credentials**: If you haven't already, visit the [Google API Console](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and create a project. Then, create API credentials for your project. You may need to enable the Google Gemini API.

2. **Download Credentials JSON**: Download the credentials as a JSON file from the Google API Console. Make sure you keep this file secure, as it contains sensitive information.

3. **Configure the Code**: In your project's codebase, locate the configuration file (typically named `config.py` or similar). Update this file with the API credentials you obtained in step 2.

   ```python
   # app.py

   google_api = "your_api_key_here"

   For requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt
